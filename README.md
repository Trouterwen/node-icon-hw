# node-icon-hw
In this homework i used node js, inquirer, chalk and readline to generate an SVG image based on user prompt

# Usage 
when called with "node index.js" the user is prompted with questions asking for the characters, text color, logo shape, and shape color for the SVG when all prompts are answered the Svg is saved and generated. To view the svg you must find the file location in explorer and click on the logo which will then be viewed in your default browser.


# notes 
I tried to emulate the OOP hw demo a closely as i could. In addition i googled some packages that could improve functionality of the svg generator and found chalk and fs-extra. both can be viewed in the code. in addition i have provided video links as requested as i forgot about those as well.
